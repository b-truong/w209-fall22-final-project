# About

Final project for the Data Visualization course.

The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is a mixed martial arts
organization that arranges and presents fights between different martial artists across the world.

This project provides visualizations for the [Kaggle UFC historical fight data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata?select=preprocessed_data.csv) with these two business purposes in mind:
* **Marketing**: enhance UFCâ€™s reach to countries where it is less widely known
* **Business Development**: expand the avenues in which a fan interacts with the UFC brand
